# Processing-3DExamplesCollection
It is a collection of several tiny examples for 3D graphics in Processing.

All of the above projects are meant to be used in Processing ( *4* and beyond, *Java* version ) out of the box. Just grab the folder and run the [project].PDE File in the Processing IDE.

## Example: FrustumOrthoPerspective
Shows how to set up a simple camera in 3D and swap between a **perspective** and an **orthographic** frustum

## Example: Projector3D
A scene containing a camera, showing the frustum of the viewing volume from near to far plane in perspective or orthographic view. Additionally, it renders the scene from a bird's eye view onto a minimap in the bottom right corner.
